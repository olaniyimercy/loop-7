            The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is
            something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people
            don't take the time to find someone who truly respect them. It seems
            like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest
            amount of attention, setting for something much less than respect. I
            am convinced one of the best ways to help ant relationship grow is
            by showing repesct.

            I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
            What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attetion,
            or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are
            valued.
